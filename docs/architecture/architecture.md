## 1. Executive Overview

This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the software system. 
It captures the structural components, interaction flows, and data models inferred from the codebase. 
The architecture is designed to support scalable business operations while maintaining strict separation of concerns.

## 2. System Context

The System Diagram below visualizes the high-level architecture, identifying key components in the Client, Server, and Infrastructure layers.

### System Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    User([User])
    subgraph Client ["Client Layer"]
        Frontend[Frontend Application]
    end
    User -->|HTTPS| Frontend
    subgraph Server ["Server Layer"]
        Backend[Backend API]
        Frontend -->|REST/GraphQL| Backend
        Auth[Auth Service/Module]
        Backend -.->|Validate Token| Auth
    end
    subgraph Infra ["Infrastructure Layer"]
        DB[(Primary Database)]
        Backend -->|Read/Write| DB
    end
    classDef client fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1565c0,color:black,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef server fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#7b1fa2,color:black,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef infra fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32,color:black,stroke-width:2px;
    class Frontend client;
    class Backend,Auth,Worker server;
    class DB,Cache,MQ,S3 infra;
```

**Architectural Highlights:**
- **Client Layer**: Responsible for user interaction and presentation logic.
- **Server Layer**: API Gateway and Service modules managing business logic and security (Auth).
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Persistent storage (Database), Caching (Redis), and Async Messaging (Queues) where applicable.

## 3. Interaction Flow

The Sequence Diagram illustrates the typical request lifecycle, demonstrating how data flows from the user, through the API, to the backing services.

### Core Request Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor User
    participant Client as Frontend Client
    participant API as Backend Service
    participant Auth as Auth Module
    participant DB as Database
    User->>Client: Internal Action / Navigation
    Client->>API: Secure API Request (Bearer Token)
    API->>Auth: Validate Session/Token
    Auth-->>API: Token Valid
        API->>DB: Query Operational Data
        DB-->>API: Result Set
    API-->>Client: JSON Response
    Client-->>User: Render Data
```

**Flow Analysis:**
1. **Secure Access**: Requests are validated via Authentication modules before processing.
2. **Optimization**: Caching mechanisms are employed to reduce database load for read-heavy operations.
3. **Asynchronous Processing**: Long-running tasks are offloaded to background workers to ensure responsive APIs.

## 4. Data Model

The Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram represents the domain model and its persistence structure.

### Domain Entities

```mermaid
erDiagram
    ACTIVITY {
        uuid id PK
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
    COMMENT {
        uuid id PK
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
    LABEL {
        uuid id PK
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
    PROJECT {
        uuid id PK
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
    TASK {
        uuid id PK
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
    USER {
        uuid id PK
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
    USER ||--o{ PROJECT : manages
    PROJECT ||--|{ TASK : contains
    TASK ||--o{ COMMENT : has
    USER ||--o{ COMMENT : owns
    USER ||--o{ ACTIVITY : owns
    USER ||--o{ LABEL : owns
```

**Key Data Structures:**
- **Core Entities**: Represents the primary business objects (e.g., User, Project, Resource).
- **Relationships**: Defines the cardinality and dependencies between data models.
