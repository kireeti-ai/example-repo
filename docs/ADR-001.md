# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to select a technology stack for a production-quality task management application that supports multiple users, projects, tasks with various attributes, and activity logging.

## Decision

### Backend
- **Node.js + Express.js**: Widely adopted, excellent ecosystem, good for REST APIs
- **MongoDB + Mongoose**: Flexible schema for evolving requirements, good for document-based data
- **JWT**: Stateless authentication, works well with SPAs

### Frontend
- **React 18**: Component-based, large ecosystem, excellent developer experience
- **Vite**: Fast build tool, modern ESM-based development
- **Vanilla CSS**: Maximum flexibility, no framework lock-in

### Testing
- **Jest + Supertest**: Standard for Node.js, excellent mocking capabilities
- **Vitest + RTL**: Fast, compatible with Vite, standard React testing

## Consequences

### Positive
- Familiar stack for most developers
- Large ecosystem and community support
- Good documentation available
- Fast development iteration

### Negative
- MongoDB requires careful schema design for complex queries
- No ORM for SQL operations if needed later
- Manual state management (no Redux) may limit complex state

## Alternatives Considered

1. **PostgreSQL**: More structured, but less flexible for evolving schemas
2. **NestJS**: More structured, but adds complexity
3. **Next.js**: SSR capabilities, but more complex for SPA use case
