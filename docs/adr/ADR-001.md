# ADR-001: System Architecture Baseline

## Status

**Accepted** (Snapshot as of 2026-02-10)

## Context

## Context

The current system architecture is being re-evaluated in response to emerging requirements for enhanced scalability, maintainability, and security. The problem space is characterized by the need to efficiently handle increasing volumes of data, ensure seamless integration with existing components, and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

The technical landscape is defined by a distributed system architecture, with a focus on modular design principles and service-oriented communication patterns. The current stack comprises a range of technologies, including [insert specific technologies, e.g., containerization using Docker, orchestration using Kubernetes, and data storage using relational databases].

Key architectural drivers influencing this decision include:

* **Scalability**: The need to accommodate growing user bases and increasing data volumes, while maintaining optimal system performance and responsiveness.
* **Maintainability**: The requirement to simplify system updates, reduce downtime, and improve overall reliability, in order to minimize the impact of maintenance activities on users.
* **Security**: The imperative to protect sensitive data and prevent unauth...

## Decision

## Decision
The architectural strategy for this enterprise distributed system will be the adoption of a Microservices Architecture with an Event-Driven Design pattern. This approach will enable the system to scale horizontally, improve fault tolerance, and enhance maintainability.

## Justification
The decision to adopt a Microservices Architecture with an Event-Driven Design pattern is justified by the detected technology stack, which includes Node.js and React. This stack is well-suited for a microservices-based approach, as Node.js provides an efficient and lightweight framework for building scalable services, while React enables the development of modular and reusable frontend components.

The use of an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) will allow the system to handle high volumes of asynchronous events, enabling real-time data processing and reducing

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Standardization**: The current architecture enforces consistent patterns across modules.
- **Maintainability**: Separation of concerns allows for targeted updates without system-wide regression risks.
- **Scalability**: The detected components support horizontal scaling for high-load scenarios.

### Negative

- **Complexity**: The distributed nature (if applicable) or modular separation introduces integration overhead.
- **Learning Curve**: Strict architectural boundaries require developer discipline and onboarding time.

## Compliance & Security

The current architecture aligns with standard security practices for this stack. 
All API endpoints should regularly undergo security scanning and validation.
